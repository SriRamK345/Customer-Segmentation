# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors. Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing and business intelligence as it helps businesses understand different customer profiles and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle (link provided below). The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to the application of the K-Means algorithm and evaluation of the results.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations
- Application of K-Means clustering for customer segmentation
- Visual representation of clusters

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle:
[Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/SriRamK345/Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/Customer_Segmentation_using_K_means_Clustering_.ipynb
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies using the command mentioned above.

3. Run the notebook `Customer_Segmentation_using_K_means_Clustering_.ipynb` to see the entire analysis, clustering, and visualizations.

## Results

The project segments customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. You can modify the number of clusters (`n_clusters` in K-Means) to fine-tune the segmentation.
